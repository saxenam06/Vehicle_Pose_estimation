# Vehicle_Pose_estimation
In this repository, I provide contribution to Theoretical derivation for Vehicle body pose SE(3) estimation using Images obtained from 4 fisheye cameras around the vehicle by minimising the Photometric errors. The derivation here is inspired from the recent paper Xiao Liu, Lin Zhang et al. Online Camera Pose Optimization for the Surround-view System https://cslinzhang.github.io/CamPoseOpt/ but with a different strategy as explained below, which make this contribution novel. 

In the paper of Xiao Liu, Lin Zhang et al. the main idea was to create a consistent surround view image from the well calibrated camera poses. The calibration is normally done offline which may not be sufficient as the camera poses can change when the vehicle experiences other dynamic motions while driving. Therefore, the authors of the paper developed finally a Ground-Camera Model which determines the correct full SE(3) poses of two (out of 4) cameras by minimizing the photometric errors between ground projections of the cameras adjacent to the two chosen for correction. The corrected pose of only of these two cameras is used results in a consistent surround view image. In contrast, I again derived the Ground-Camera model equations with the focus to determine only the corrected full SE(3) pose of the C.G. of the vehicle rigid body, which in my opinion makes more sense as the 4 cameras are rigidly mounted on the vehicle body and the main source behind the change of the camera poses is infact the change of the pose of Vehicle body. Therefore, I propose to determine the optimum Vehicle body full SE(3) pose that minimise the photometric error of all the overlapping ground projections of all the cameras.
